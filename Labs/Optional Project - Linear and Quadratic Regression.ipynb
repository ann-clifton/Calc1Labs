So if $(x_1,y_1)$ is a data point, the distance from the line's prediction $y(x_1)$ to the actual value $y_1$, is given by $|ax_1+b-y_1|$. The problem with this definition of error, is that it's not differentiable at every point, so minimizing it can be difficult. \n",

    "### Your Job\n",
    "Your task is to do the following:\n",
    "1) Write a system of 3 equations in the 3 unkowns $a,b$, and $c$. Make sure to include your equations in your report and you must explain the reasoning for your equations in your report.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Solve the equations in (1) with SageMath to find the values $a,b$, and $c$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Define the regression function $y(x)=ax^2+bx+c$ and plot it in the same window as your data.\n",

    "4) Use SageMath to compute the MSE of yoru predictions and discuss the error in your report. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Extra Credit\n",
    "Fabricate some data of your own that follows a sine, logarithmic, cubic (or really any function you want) pattern and find the function of best fit accordingly. Let me know if you need help creating the appropriate data so that you can perform the regression. I'm more than happy to help with that part. \n",

For instance, SageMath can regress $a\\cdot\\text{sin}(x)+b$ just fine, but has trouble with $a\\cdot\\text{sin}(bx)+c$ where an unknown is on the inside of the $\\text{sin}$. To save yourself time and frustration, I would suggest just sticking with a pattern like $a\\cdot f(x) + b\\cdot g(x) +c$ where all unknowns are $\\mathbf{outside}$ of the functions $f$ and $g$. "
